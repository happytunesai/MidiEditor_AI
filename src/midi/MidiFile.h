/**
 * \class MidiFile
 *
 * \brief Core class representing a complete MIDI file with all its data and functionality.
 *
 * MidiFile is the central class of the MIDI editor, managing all aspects of MIDI
 * file handling, playback, and editing. It provides comprehensive functionality for:
 *
 * - **File I/O**: Loading and saving MIDI files in standard format
 * - **Track management**: Multiple MIDI tracks with independent content
 * - **Channel management**: 16 MIDI channels per track
 * - **Event management**: All types of MIDI events and meta-events
 * - **Timing**: Tempo changes, time signatures, and timing calculations
 * - **Protocol integration**: Full undo/redo support for all operations
 * - **Playback support**: Integration with MIDI playback systems
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Standard MIDI file format support (Type 0 and Type 1)
 * - Real-time event manipulation and editing
 * - Comprehensive timing and measure calculations
 * - Multi-track and multi-channel organization
 * - Protocol-based undo/redo for all changes
 * - Event filtering and selection capabilities
 * - Tempo and time signature management
 *
 * The class serves as both a data container and a controller, managing
 * the relationships between tracks, channels, events, and timing information.
