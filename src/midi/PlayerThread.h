/**
 * \class PlayerThread
 *
 * \brief Thread-based MIDI file playback engine.
 *
 * PlayerThread handles the real-time playback of MIDI files in a separate
 * thread to ensure smooth performance without blocking the user interface.
 * It provides:
 *
 * - **Threaded playback**: Non-blocking MIDI file playback
 * - **Timing precision**: Accurate MIDI event timing and scheduling
 * - **Real-time updates**: Position and measure tracking during playback
 * - **Event processing**: Sequential MIDI event transmission
 * - **Playback control**: Start, stop, and position management
 * - **Status signals**: Real-time feedback to the UI
 *
 * Key features:
 * - High-precision timing using QElapsedTimer
 * - Automatic tempo and time signature tracking
 * - Measure and beat position calculation
 * - Thread-safe playback control
 * - Integration with MIDI output system
 *
 * The thread processes MIDI events in chronological order and sends
 * them to the MIDI output system at the correct times.
