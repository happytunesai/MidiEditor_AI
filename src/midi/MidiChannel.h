/**
 * \class MidiChannel
 *
 * \brief Represents a MIDI channel containing events for a specific instrument.
 *
 * MidiChannel manages all MIDI events for a specific channel within the MIDI file.
 * The MIDI editor uses 18 channels in total:
 *
 * - **Channels 0-15**: Standard MIDI channels for instruments
 * - **Channel 16**: General events (like PitchBend)
 * - **Channel 17**: Tempo change events
 * - **Channel 18**: Time signature events
 *
 * Key features:
 * - **Event management**: Stores and organizes all events for the channel
 * - **Visibility control**: Show/hide channel in the matrix widget
 * - **Mute control**: Enable/disable channel playback
 * - **Solo mode**: Play only this channel (mutes all others)
 * - **Color coding**: Visual identification in the editor
 * - **Program tracking**: Maintains current instrument program
 * - **Note insertion**: Convenient methods for adding notes
 *
 * Events are stored in a QMultiMap organized by MIDI tick time, allowing
 * efficient time-based access and manipulation.
