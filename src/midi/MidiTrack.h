/**
 * \class MidiTrack
 *
 * \brief Represents a single MIDI track within a MIDI file.
 *
 * MidiTrack manages a collection of MIDI events that belong to a specific
 * track in the MIDI file. Each track can contain events for multiple MIDI
 * channels and provides organization and management capabilities:
 *
 * - **Event organization**: Groups related MIDI events together
 * - **Track naming**: User-friendly track names and identification
 * - **Channel assignment**: Default channel assignment for new events
 * - **Visibility control**: Show/hide tracks in the editor
 * - **Mute control**: Enable/disable track playback
 * - **Color coding**: Visual identification in the editor
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Protocol integration for undo/redo support
 * - Track name management with TextEvent integration
 * - Channel assignment for streamlined event creation
 * - Visibility and mute state management
 * - Color customization for visual organization
 * - Integration with the parent MidiFile
 *
 * Tracks provide a logical grouping mechanism that helps organize complex
 * MIDI compositions with multiple instruments or parts.
