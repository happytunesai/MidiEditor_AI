/**
 * \class TempoChangeEvent
 *
 * \brief MIDI Tempo Change event for controlling playback speed.
 *
 * TempoChangeEvent represents MIDI Tempo Change meta-events, which control
 * the playback tempo of the MIDI sequence. These events are crucial for
 * musical timing and expression.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - **BPM control**: Sets the beats per minute for playback
 * - **Timing precision**: Affects the duration of all subsequent events
 * - **Meta-event**: Not channel-specific, affects the entire sequence
 * - **Real-time changes**: Allows tempo changes during playback
 * - **Musical expression**: Enables rubato, accelerando, ritardando
 *
 * The tempo is stored internally as microseconds per quarter note,
 * which provides high precision for timing calculations.
