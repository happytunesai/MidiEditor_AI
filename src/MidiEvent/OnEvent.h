 *
 * OnEvent represents MIDI events that have a duration and require a corresponding
 * "off" event to mark their end. This is primarily used for note events where
 * a Note On event is paired with a Note Off event.
 *
 * The class maintains a bidirectional relationship with its corresponding OffEvent,
 * allowing for proper event pairing and duration calculations.
