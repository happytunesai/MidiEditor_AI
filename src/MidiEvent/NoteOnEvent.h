/**
 * \class NoteOnEvent
 *
 * \brief MIDI Note On event representing the start of a musical note.
 *
 * NoteOnEvent represents a MIDI Note On message, which starts a musical note
 * with a specific pitch and velocity. This is the most common type of MIDI
 * event used in musical compositions.
 *
 * Key properties:
 * - **Note**: MIDI note number (0-127, where 60 = Middle C)
 * - **Velocity**: How hard the note was pressed (0-127, affects volume/timbre)
 * - **Duration**: Determined by the corresponding OffEvent
 * - **Channel**: MIDI channel for the note (0-15)
 *
 * The event automatically pairs with a corresponding OffEvent to define
 * the note's duration and provides visual representation in the piano roll editor.
