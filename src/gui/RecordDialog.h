 *
 * RecordDialog appears after MIDI recording is complete and allows users to
 * configure how the recorded MIDI data should be imported into the project:
 *
 * - **Channel assignment**: Select which MIDI channel to use for recorded events
 * - **Track assignment**: Choose which track to add the recorded events to
 * - **Event filtering**: Select which types of events to import
 * - **Settings persistence**: Remember user preferences for future recordings
 *
 * The dialog provides a user-friendly interface for processing recorded MIDI
 * data and integrating it into the existing project structure.
