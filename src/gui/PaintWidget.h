/**
 * \class PaintWidget
 *
 * \brief Base widget class with enhanced mouse event handling and painting support.
 *
 * PaintWidget extends QWidget to provide specialized mouse event handling
 * and painting capabilities commonly needed in the MIDI editor. It offers:
 *
 * - **Enhanced mouse tracking**: Detailed mouse position and movement tracking
 * - **Configurable repainting**: Control when repaints occur based on mouse events
 * - **Drag detection**: Built-in support for drag operations
 * - **Mouse state management**: Comprehensive mouse state tracking
 * - **Geometric utilities**: Helper methods for mouse position testing
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Tracks current and previous mouse positions
 * - Provides movement and drag distance calculations
 * - Supports mouse pinning for constrained operations
 * - Configurable repaint triggers for performance optimization
 * - Rectangle and line intersection testing for mouse interactions
 *
 * This class serves as the foundation for interactive widgets like MatrixWidget
 * that require precise mouse handling and custom painting.
