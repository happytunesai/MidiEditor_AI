 * \class Terminal
 *
 * \brief Terminal interface for external MIDI processes and debugging.
 *
 * The Terminal class provides a console interface for running external MIDI
 * processes and displaying their output. It's primarily used for:
 *
 * - Running external MIDI tools and utilities
 * - Debugging MIDI connections and port configurations
 * - Displaying process output and error messages
 * - Managing MIDI port connections
 *
 * The terminal uses a singleton pattern and integrates with Qt's process
 * management system to provide a unified interface for external tool execution.
