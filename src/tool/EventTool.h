/**
 * \class EventTool
 *
 * \brief Base class for tools that work with MIDI events.
 *
 * EventTool provides common functionality for all tools that manipulate MIDI events.
 * It serves as the base class for most editing tools in the MIDI editor and provides:
 *
 * - Event selection and deselection management
 * - Copy/paste operations for events
 * - Shared clipboard functionality for cross-instance operations
 * - Grid snapping (magnet) functionality
 * - Event positioning and timing utilities
 * - Visual feedback for selected events
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Static selection management shared across all event tools
 * - Integration with the protocol system for undo/redo
 * - Support for both local and shared clipboard operations
 * - Grid alignment assistance for precise editing
