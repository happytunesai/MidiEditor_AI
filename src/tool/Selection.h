/**
 * \class Selection
 *
 * \brief Manages the current selection of MIDI events in the editor.
 *
 * Selection is a singleton class that maintains the current set of selected
 * MIDI events across the entire application. It provides centralized selection
 * management with protocol support for undo/redo operations.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - **Singleton pattern**: Global access to the current selection
 * - **Protocol integration**: Selection changes can be undone/redone
 * - **Event management**: Add, remove, and clear selected events
 * - **Widget integration**: Synchronizes with EventWidget display
 * - **Multi-selection**: Supports selecting multiple events simultaneously
 *
 * The selection is used by various tools and widgets to determine which
 * events should be affected by operations like move, copy, delete, etc.
 * It maintains consistency across all views and provides a unified
 * interface for selection management.
