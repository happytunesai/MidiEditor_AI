 * \class MeasureTool
 *
 * \brief Tool for selecting and highlighting measures in the MIDI editor.
 *
 * The MeasureTool allows users to select one or more measures in the MIDI editor
 * by clicking and dragging. Selected measures are visually highlighted, making it
 * easier to work with specific sections of the composition.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Click to select a single measure
 * - Drag to select multiple consecutive measures
 * - Visual feedback with highlighted measure regions
 * - Integration with the editor's selection system
