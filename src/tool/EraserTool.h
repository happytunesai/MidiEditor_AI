/**
 * \class EraserTool
 *
 * \brief Tool for deleting MIDI events by clicking or dragging over them.
 *
 * The EraserTool allows users to delete MIDI events by simply clicking on them
 * or dragging over multiple events. It provides an intuitive way to remove
 * unwanted notes and events from the composition.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - **Click to delete**: Single click removes individual events
 * - **Drag to delete**: Drag over multiple events to delete them all
 * - **Visual feedback**: Shows which events will be deleted
 * - **Undo support**: All deletions can be undone through the protocol system
 * - **Safe operation**: Only deletes events that are directly clicked/dragged over
