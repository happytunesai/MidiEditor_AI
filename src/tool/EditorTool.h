/**
 * \class EditorTool
 *
 * \brief Base class for interactive editing tools in the MIDI editor.
 *
 * EditorTool provides the foundation for all interactive editing tools that
 * operate on the matrix widget. These tools handle user input and provide
 * visual feedback for editing operations:
 *
 * - **Tool selection**: Only one EditorTool can be active at a time
 * - **Visual feedback**: Tools draw overlays and cursors on the matrix
 * - **Input handling**: Process mouse clicks, drags, and keyboard input
 * - **Widget integration**: Connect to MatrixWidget for editing
 * - **State management**: Maintain tool-specific state and settings
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Exclusive selection (selecting one deselects others)
 * - Custom drawing capabilities for visual feedback
 * - Mouse and keyboard event handling
 * - Integration with the matrix widget coordinate system
 * - Protocol integration for undo/redo support
 *
 * Common editor tools include SelectTool, NewNoteTool, EraserTool, etc.
 * Each tool provides specialized functionality for different editing tasks.
