 * The SelectTool provides different ways to select MIDI events in the editor:
 *
 * - **Single selection**: Click on individual events
 * - **Box selection**: Drag to create a selection rectangle
 * - **Left-click selection**: Standard left-click selection behavior
 * - **Right-click selection**: Right-click selection behavior
 *
 * The tool supports both additive selection (holding modifiers) and
 * replacement selection (clearing previous selections). It provides
 * visual feedback during box selection operations.
