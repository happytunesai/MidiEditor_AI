/**
 * \class NewNoteTool
 *
 * \brief Tool for creating new MIDI note events.
 *
 * The NewNoteTool allows users to create new MIDI notes by clicking and dragging
 * in the matrix editor. The tool provides:
 *
 * - **Click to create**: Single click creates a note with default length
 * - **Drag to size**: Click and drag to set the note duration
 * - **Visual feedback**: Shows preview of the note being created
 * - **Track/channel targeting**: Notes are created on the specified track and channel
 *
 * The tool maintains static settings for the target track and channel,
 * which can be configured through the UI or programmatically.
