/**
 * \class DeleteOverlapsTool
 *
 * \brief Tool for deleting overlapping notes in different modes.
 *
 * The DeleteOverlapsTool provides three different modes for handling overlapping notes:
 * 1. Delete Overlaps (Mono) - Delete overlapping notes on the same pitch
 * 2. Delete Overlaps (Poly) - Make the part monophonic by shortening all overlapping notes
 * 3. Delete Doubles - Remove notes that are on the same pitch at the exact same position
 *
 * This is similar to the functionality found in Cubase and other DAWs.
