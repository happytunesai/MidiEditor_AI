/**
 * \class GlueTool
 *
 * \brief Tool for merging adjacent notes of the same pitch.
 *
 * The GlueTool allows users to merge adjacent MIDI notes that have the same
 * pitch (note number) and channel. This is similar to the "Glue" functionality
 * found in Cubase and other DAWs.
 *
 * The tool works by:
 * 1. Finding all selected notes or notes in the current view
 * 2. Grouping them by pitch and channel
 * 3. Identifying adjacent notes (notes that touch or overlap)
 * 4. Merging adjacent notes into a single note that spans from the start
 *    of the first note to the end of the last note
