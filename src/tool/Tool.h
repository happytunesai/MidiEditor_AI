 * \brief Tool is the superclass for every Tool in the program.
 *
 * Every Tool can be represented by a ToolButton; for this is has to be set
 * either an image or an imagetext.
 *
 * Tool inherits ProtocolEntry, so every action on a Tool can be written to the
 * history of the program.
 *
 * The method selected() can be used to give the ToolButton another background.
 *
 * A Tool can either be accessed using the Toolbuttons or it may be set by the
 * StandardTool.
 * This Tool decides on every click in the Editor which Tool to take.
 * If a tool has a StandardTool not equal 0, it has to return to this standard
 * tool when its action has been finished.
