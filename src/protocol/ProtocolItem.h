 * \brief Single undo/redo action storing old and new object states.
 *
 * ProtocolItem represents a single reversible action in the undo/redo system.
 * It stores both the old and new states of a ProtocolEntry, enabling
 * bidirectional state transitions:
 *
 * - **State preservation**: Stores both before and after states
 * - **Reversible actions**: Can undo and redo operations
 * - **Efficient storage**: Only stores the changed object states
 * - **Protocol integration**: Works with the Protocol system
 *
 * The item can be "released" to restore the old state and create
 * a reverse ProtocolItem for redo functionality.
