 * \class ProtocolStep
 *
 * \brief A complete undo/redo step containing multiple related actions.
 *
 * ProtocolStep represents a logical group of related actions that should be
 * undone or redone together as a single unit. It contains a stack of
 * ProtocolItems that represent individual state changes:
 *
 * - **Action grouping**: Multiple related changes in one undo/redo step
 * - **Stack management**: LIFO ordering for proper undo sequence
 * - **Bidirectional**: Can be released to create the reverse step
 * - **Visual identity**: Description and icon for UI display
 * - **Atomic operations**: All items in a step are processed together
 *
 * For example, moving multiple selected notes would create one ProtocolStep
 * containing multiple ProtocolItems (one for each moved note). When undone,
 * all notes return to their original positions in a single operation.
